# Close Project Workspace

You are helping a developer close a project workspace by marking it as
done. This updates the project's CLAUDE.md frontmatter and optionally
records closing notes.

Everything after the skill name in `$ARGUMENTS` is parsed as follows:
- The **first token** is an optional project name or numeric shorthand.
- Everything after the first token is treated as **closing notes**.

## Step 1: Select Project

**1a. Resolve project name**

Extract the first token from `$ARGUMENTS`. Run
`python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/resume-project.py" <first-token>`
via Bash (omit the token if none was provided). Parse the JSON and handle
by `status`:

- **`ok`** — use `project.name` as the target. All paths in `project` are
  **absolute** — use them directly in Read/Bash (no joining). Proceed to 1b.
- **`no_argument`** — check if a project was loaded earlier in this
  conversation (e.g., via `/workspace:resume-project`). If so, use that project
  name as the default: re-run the script with that name and proceed.
  Otherwise, present the first 3 `alternatives` as AskUserQuestion
  options plus "See all projects". Re-run with the chosen name.
- **`not_found`** / **`out_of_range`** — show `error_message`, present
  `alternatives` as a picker, re-run with chosen name.
- **`no_projects`** — show `error_message` and stop.
- **`error`** — if the message mentions **PyYAML**, relay the install
  command (`pip3 install pyyaml`) rather than retrying. Otherwise show the
  message and stop.

**1b. Check current status**

If `project.frontmatter.status` is `done`:
- Inform the user: "Project `<name>` is already marked as done."
- Ask if they'd like to update the closing notes anyway. If no, stop.

## Step 2: Gather Closing Notes

**2a. Extract notes from arguments**

If there is text after the project identifier in `$ARGUMENTS`, use it
as the closing notes.

**2b. Ask for notes**

If no notes were provided in the arguments, ask the user:

> "Any closing notes for this project? (outcome, resolution, links to
> PRs, etc.) Say 'no' to skip."

## Step 2.5: Worktree & Skill Cleanup

Substeps 2.5a-2.5d apply if `P.worktree_status` (from Step 1's
resume-project.py output) is non-empty; substep 2.5e applies if
`P.frontmatter.skills` is non-empty. If neither, skip to Step 3.

**2.5a. Display worktree status**

Show a status summary from `P.worktree_status`:

```
| Repo | Branch | Status |
|------|--------|--------|
```

Where status is derived from each entry in `P.worktree_status`:
- `exists=false` → `MISSING` (already gone, skip cleanup)
- `error` is non-null → `ERROR: <message>`
- `dirty=true` and `ahead > 0` → `dirty (N files), ahead by N`
- `dirty=true` → `dirty (N files)`
- `no_upstream=true` → `no upstream (local-only commits)`
- `ahead > 0` → `ahead by N`
- otherwise → `clean`

**2.5b. Handle worktrees needing attention**

If any worktree is dirty, has unpushed commits (`ahead > 0`), or has
no upstream (`no_upstream=true`), warn the user:

> "The following worktrees need attention before removal:
>   - `<repo>` (`<branch>`): <status detail>
>
> What would you like to do?"

Use AskUserQuestion with options:
- "Commit and push changes before closing"
- "Discard changes and remove worktrees"
- "Keep worktrees (close project but leave them in place)"

If "commit and push": help the user commit and push in each worktree.
For `no_upstream` branches, push with `-u` to set the upstream:
`git -C <worktree-path> push -u fork <branch>`
(each worktree's `path` in `P.worktree_status` is absolute).

**2.5c. Remove worktrees**

Unless the user chose to keep worktrees, remove each existing worktree.
The worktree `path` and the repo checkout are derivable from
`P.worktree_status` (paths are absolute). For a repo at
`<workspace>/repos/<repo>`:

```bash
# If user chose "Discard changes" (worktree may be dirty):
git -C <workspace>/repos/<repo> worktree remove --force .worktrees/<branch>
# If worktree is clean (user chose "Commit and push" or was already clean):
git -C <workspace>/repos/<repo> worktree remove .worktrees/<branch>
```

For non-PR branches (those NOT starting with `pr/`), also offer to
delete the local branch:
```bash
git -C <workspace>/repos/<repo> branch -d <branch>
```

For PR checkout branches (`pr/<number>`), just delete the local branch
— these are local refs created from the remote PR, not remote branches:
```bash
git -C <workspace>/repos/<repo> branch -D pr/<number>
```

**2.5d. Update frontmatter**

If worktrees were removed, the `worktrees:` field will be cleared
in Step 3b (set to `worktrees: []`).

If worktrees were kept, leave the field as-is and add a note to the
closing summary: "Worktrees preserved — branches still active in repos."

**2.5e. Remove skill symlinks**

If `P.frontmatter.skills` is non-empty, check which linked skills are
still needed by other active projects:

```bash
python3 "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/skills.py" unlink-check <P.name>
```

If the output has `status: "error"`, mention it and continue to Step 3.
Otherwise, for each entry in `skills`:

- `removable: true` → remove the symlink (plain `rm` — the target is a
  symlink, never use `rm -r`):

  ```bash
  rm "<workspace>/.claude/skills/<name>"
  ```

- `removable: false` with non-empty `used_by` → keep it; report:
  "Skill `<name>` kept — still used by `<used_by>`."
- `missing: true` → nothing to remove; skip silently.
- `removable: false` with `is_symlink: false` → not ours to delete;
  report: "`.claude/skills/<name>` is not a symlink — left in place."

Skills are unlinked even when the user chose to keep worktrees in 2.5b —
symlinks surface autocomplete entries and have nothing to do with
branches. The `skills:` frontmatter is cleared in Step 3b regardless of
what was removable.

## Step 3: Update Project CLAUDE.md

**3a. Read the current CLAUDE.md**

Read the full `project.context_file` (absolute path from Step 1).

**3b. Update frontmatter fields**

Using the Edit tool, update the YAML frontmatter:

1. Change `status: active` (or whatever the current status is) to
   `status: done`
2. Add a `closed: <YYYY-MM-DD>` field (today's date) after the
   `status` line. If a `closed:` field already exists, update it.
3. If worktrees were removed in Step 2.5, change the `worktrees:`
   list to `worktrees: []`. Leave `branch:` as-is for historical
   reference.
4. If the project had a `skills:` list, change it to `skills: []`
   (the symlinks were handled in Step 2.5e; the cleared list records
   that this project no longer holds any skill references).

**3c. Add closing notes section**

If the user provided closing notes (non-empty, not "no"):

Closing Notes always go in CLAUDE.md (the index), not in detail files.

1. Check if a `## Closing Notes` section already exists in the file.
2. If it exists, replace its content with the new notes.
3. If it doesn't exist, add a `## Closing Notes` section at the end
   of the file with the notes and today's date:

```markdown
## Closing Notes

_Closed YYYY-MM-DD_

<user's closing notes>
```

## Step 4: Confirm Closure

Display a brief confirmation:

```
Project `<name>` marked as done.
```

If closing notes were added, include them in the confirmation.
Remind the user that closed projects won't appear in the SessionStart
summary, but can still be resumed with `/workspace:resume-project <name>`.

---

## Important Notes

- Always use the Read tool before editing, and Edit tool for changes
- Never delete the project directory — closing just updates metadata
- Use today's date for the `closed` field
- The project will be filtered from the SessionStart "Recent projects"
  table but remains fully accessible via `/workspace:resume-project`
